### Markdown

Popular format used across many projects.
Most README files on github use markdown  
(use .md in source)

### Textile

Another popular format use   
(.textile in source)


### HTML
Of course you can use HTML  
(.html)

### HTML.erb
Use erb for more more logic in your templates.
These are converted into a static .html file like
everything else at build time so they are not
"dynamic" but they can help you build loops
or incorporate other files into the .erb file.
